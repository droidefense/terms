# Privacy Policy

We at **Droidefense**, Inc (Social) respect the privacy of your personal information and make every effort to ensure your information is protected and remains private. As the owner and operator of the application **Droidefense** (the “App”), and our website https://droidefense.github.io/terms/ (the “Website” or “Site”), hereafter referred to in this Privacy Policy collectively as **“Droidefense”**, “us”, “our” or “we”, we have provided this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, share and protect information about the users of our mobile App and our Website (hereafter referred to as “user”, “you” or “your”). For the purposes of this Agreement and our Terms of Service, any use of the terms **“Droidefense”**, “us”, “our” or “we” includes Social, without limitation. We will not use or share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy will inform you about the types of personal data we collect, the purposes for which we use the data, the ways in which the data is handled and your rights with regard to your personal data. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy is intended to satisfy the obligation of transparency under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the laws implementing the GDPR.

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy the “Data Controller” of personal data is Social and our contact details are set out in the Contact section at the end of this Privacy Policy. Data Controller means the natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information are, or are to be, processed.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” or “Personal Data” means information about you, which may be of a confidential or sensitive nature and may include personally identifiable information (“PII”) and/or financial information. PII means individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of a specific living person, while sensitive data may include information, comments, content and other information that you voluntarily provide.

**Droidefense** collects information about you when you use our App or Website to access our services (the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications, you have with us.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Website and in the App. If the changes to the Privacy Policy are significant, we may send you an email notice. Those changes will go into effect on the “Last Updated” date shown at the end of this Privacy Policy.

By using or continuing to use the App, Website or Services, you consent to these and any revised Privacy Policy terms. We encourage you to periodically review the Privacy Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.

## Our Privacy Commitment to you

**Droidefense** will only collect the data that we need to operate our Services and provide our users with a private, secure, safe, smooth and efficient messaging experience. We use our patent-pending “Ninja Mode” end-to-end encrypted messaging technology to provide a secure private message thread. Once the conversation is deactivated, the thread will delete itself and black line redactions will appear in the primary thread. Upon disabling Ninja Mode, all copies of conversations sent in Ninja Mode encryption will be deleted from the users devices and **Droidefense** servers. In keeping with our commitment to use your data only for the successful operation of our services, **Droidefense** does not use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes, and we do not host advertising in our App. To improve our services, we may use data we collect in an aggregated and de-identified form which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
